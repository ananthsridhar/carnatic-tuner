Tune your Carnatic instruments to the classic Carnatic swaras instead of constantly calculating the Western-Carnatic co-relation!

When I started learning the Veena recently, one of the biggest problems I faced was tuning my Veena strings to the right pitch. This involved taking my teacher's assistance, who manually tuned it by ear to perfection, either in person or through Skype. 
  
Sure that there definitely are other Carnatic newbies out there like me who probably face the same or similar issues, I set out to develop a Progressive Web App that is both minimalistic yet handy, to quickly help people make sure their strings are at the right tautness, so time and effort can better be spent on that much-needed practice!

This is still a work-in-progress, so you should hopefully see it get better!
